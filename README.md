# BAUMANNZONE.DEV

My personal website and blog made with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
