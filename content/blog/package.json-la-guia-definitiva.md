The Basics of Package.json
In this chapter, we'll give you a kickstart introduction to effectively using package.json with Node.js and npm.

The package.json file is core to the Node.js ecosystem and is a fundamental part of understanding and working with Node.js, npm, and even modern JavaScript. This file is used as a manifest, storing information about applications, modules, packages, and more. Because understanding it is essential to working with Node.js, it's a good idea to grasp the commonly found and most crucial properties of a package.json file to use it effectively.

This is a series, based on one of the most featured whitepapers we have done by developers in the Node.js ecosystem. If you are interested in the complete guide, you can get it through this link.
